<h3>Current first author projects:</h3>
<h4>Evaluating Visual Prosthetic Efficacy
  With Immersive Virtual Reality Simulations</h4>
<p>A multi-study research project focused on evaluating retinal prosthetics through the use of virtual reality simulations. Following the <a href="https://pulse2percept.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">pulse2percept</a> framework, 
  I have developed a biologically relevant, virtual reality simulation of bionic vision. Over the next few years, I will be validating my model and using it to study the currently available technology for bionic vision. <br>Expected Completion: 2023. <br>Principal Investigator: M Beyeler</p>
<h4>Systematic Review: Virtual/Augmented Reality and its Usage for Low Vision and Retinal Prosthetics</h4>
<p>A literature review following <a href="http://prisma-statement.org/documents/PRISMA%202009%20flow%20diagram.pdf">PRISMA</a> guidelines. Summarizes how VR/AR has been used for low vision individuals through accessability enhancement and low vision simulations. Highlights the current lack of biologically relevant models for bionic vision and needs moving forward. <br>Expected Completion: 2022. <br>Co-authors: B Johnson, R Neydavood, A Akkaraju | Principal Investigator: M Beyeler

<h4>Individual Differences in Navigation through Diffusion MRI Tractography</h4>
<p>In this study, participants navigated through a virtual maze while their brain activity was recorded using fMRI. Diffusion images were taken before and after the task and multiple toolboxes (<a href="http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org/">DSI-Studio</a>, <a href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/TBSS/UserGuide">TBSS</a>, <a href="https://readthedocs.org/projects/mdt-toolbox/downloads/pdf/master/">MDT</a>) were used to analyze the individual differences in brain structure that are correlated with performance. <br>Expected Completion: 2022. <br>Co-authors: H Radhakrishnan, A Tharinipathy | Principal Investigator: E Chrastil</p>
